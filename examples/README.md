# Progressive examples

this directory will contain examples that progressively add features.

The features are in order:

1. `minimum_window`: Just displays a window with a background color
2. `img_backend`: Uses an image backend to create a png file from the game loop.
3. `multiple_backends`: Shows that we can use our same game loop with multiple backends. ie: shows off code reuse.
4. `simple_grid`: Shows that we can use the Canvas api in `src/lib.rs` to draw lines
